I'm a dedicated computer engineering student at Toronto Metropolitan University with a passion for programming, particularly in Python, and hands-on experience with Arduino projects. I enjoy experimenting with electronics, from building circuits to implementing creative solutions in embedded systems. I thrive on the challenges that engineering competitions bring, collaborating with my friends to push the boundaries of innovation. My curiosity drives me to continuously expand my knowledge, whether it's delving into new programming languages or exploring the latest advancements in electronics and technology.
